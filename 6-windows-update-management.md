When a restart is scheduled, this option is available to temporarily override active hours and schedule a custom time to finish installing the current update(s). Make sure your device is plugged in at the scheduled time.


The Custom restart time option is grayed out if there arenâ€™t any pending updates or no restart is scheduled.
